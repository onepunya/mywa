      question: "What is a WhatsApp API Gateway?",
      answer: "A WhatsApp API Gateway is a service that allows you to programmatically send and receive WhatsApp messages through your own number. It acts as a bridge between your application and the WhatsApp network, enabling automated notifications, customer support bots, and much more."
   },
   {
      question: "Is this service official from WhatsApp?",
      answer: "No, this is an unofficial gateway that uses web automation to connect to your WhatsApp account. It is intended for personal projects, small businesses, and developers who need a simple way to integrate WhatsApp messaging without going through the complex setup of the official WhatsApp Business API."
   },
   {
      question: "How do I connect my number?",
      answer: "You can connect your number in two ways from the login or terminal page: <br>1. <strong>Scan QR Code:</strong> A QR code will be displayed, which you can scan using the 'Linked Devices' option in your WhatsApp application. <br>2. <strong>Pairing Code:</strong> An 8-character code will be generated. You need to enter this code in the 'Linked Devices' section of your WhatsApp application by selecting 'Link with phone number'."
   },
   {
      question: "Is it safe to use this service?",
      answer: "The connection is established directly from the server to WhatsApp. We do not store your messages. However, since this is an unofficial service, there is always a minimal risk associated with using it. We recommend using a number that is not your primary personal number for critical applications."
   },
   {
      question: "Can I get banned by WhatsApp?",
      answer: "The risk of being banned is very low if you use the service for normal communication and do not engage in spamming (sending a large number of unsolicited messages). Avoid sending messages to unknown contacts in bulk. The system is designed to mimic normal user behavior to minimize risk."
   },
   {
      question: "Does this support n8n automation?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. The gateway is designed for automation platforms like n8n. Integration is straightforward because a form to input your webhook URL has been provided. Simply set up an n8n workflow with a 'Webhook' trigger node, copy its URL, and paste it into the webhook form on our platform to start receiving events."
